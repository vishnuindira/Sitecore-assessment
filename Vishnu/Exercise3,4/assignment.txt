Exercise 3: Linux problem solving
Q : We have an issue with Redis on this machine. It's not starting. Please diagnose and solve the issue.


Step 1: logged into the provided machine using ip and ppk.
Step 2: Verified whether the redis installed or not using  below command

        command :redis-server --version
        
        output : Redis server v=3.0.6 sha=00000000:0 malloc=jemalloc-3.6.0 bits=64 build=7785291a3d2152db
        
Step 3: Checked redis is running or not using below command

        command :redis-cli ping
        output : Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379: Connection refused
        
        It was not running 
Step 4: Tried starting the redis server using 

	command: redis-server
	output: Redis 3.0.6 (00000000/0) 64 bit

25440:M 09 Oct 07:41:34.593 # WARNING: The TCP backlog setting of 511 cannot be enforced because /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn is set to the lower value of 128.
25440:M 09 Oct 07:41:34.593 # Server started, Redis version 3.0.6
25440:M 09 Oct 07:41:34.593 # WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background save may fail under low memory condition. To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
25440:M 09 Oct 07:41:34.594 # WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) support enabled in your kernel. This will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. To fix this issue run the command 'echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your /etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be restarted after THP is disabled.
25440:M 09 Oct 07:41:34.594 * DB loaded from disk: 0.000 seconds
25440:M 09 Oct 07:41:34.594 * The server is now ready to accept connections on port 6379


Step 5: Verified uing the ping again :
	command :redis-cli ping 
	output :PONG

Now redis is up and running
